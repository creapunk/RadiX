The RadiX Drive is a high-performance, quad/six-channel PWM driver capable of delivering up to 450/1500W of power. Its design is optimized for controlling inductive and resistive loads, making it ideal for a variety of motor types as well as solenoids and transformers. The driver's "bare metal" architecture excludes unnecessary components, which reduces its cost, physical size, and heat output while enabling customization for specific applications. The use of a single board-to-board connector and a unified module design streamlines the integration process by cutting down on wiring complexity and ensuring stable electrical connections. The RadiX Drive supports a wide array of interfaces and encoders, enhancing its versatility across different applications. It is compatible with DC, BLDC, PMSM, and Stepper motors.
